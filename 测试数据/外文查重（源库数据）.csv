1001,Íõå«îÚ,GENERALIZE,"    Underneath we are simple of carry on the introduction to it. JSP pages are translated into servlets. So, fundamentally, any task JSP pages can perform could also be accomplished by servlets. However, this underlying equivalence does not mean that servlets and JSP pages are equally appropriate in all scenarios. The issue is not the power of the technology, it is the convenience, productivity, and  maintainability of one or the other. After all, anything you can do on a particular computer platform in the Java programming language you could also do in assembly language. But it still matters which you choose. JSP provides the following benefits over servlets alone:",,
1001,Íõå«îÚ,GENERALIZE,"    It is easier to write and maintain the HTML. Your static code is ordinary HTML: no extra backslashes, no double quotes, and no lurking Java syntax. You can use standard Web-site development tools. Even HTML tools that know nothing about JSP can be used because they simply ignore the JSP tags. You can divide up your development team. The Java programmers can work on the dynamic code. The Web developers can concentrate on the presentation layer. On large projects, this division is very important. Depending on the size of your team and the complexity of your project, you can enforce a weaker or stronger separation between the static HTML and the dynamic content.",,
1001,Íõå«îÚ,GENERALIZE,"    Now, this discussion is not to say that you should stop using servlets and use only JSP instead. By no means. Almost all projects will use both. For some requests in your project, you will use servlets. For others, you will use JSP. For still others, you will combine them with the MVC architecture . You want the appropriate tool for the job, and servlets, by themselves, do not complete your toolkit.",,

Use the perhaps small script future life of marking of JSP becomes the dynamic state on the page contents.( the contents changes according to the claim of) The Java Servlet is a technical foundation of JSP, and the large Web applies the development of the procedure to need the Java Servlet to match with with the JSP and then can complete, this name of Servlet comes from the Applet, the local translation method of now is a lot of, this book in order not   to misconstruction, decide the direct adoption Servlet but don't do any translation, if reader would like to, can call it as small service procedure. The Servlet is similar to traditional CGI, ISAPI, NSAPI etc. Web procedure development the function of the tool in fact, at use the Java Servlet hereafter, the customer need not use again the lowly method of CGI of efficiency, also need not use only the ability come to born page of Web of dynamic state in the method of API that a certain fixed Web server terrace circulate. Many servers of Web all support the Servlet,",,
1002,Íõçå,SOURCE OF JSP  ,"even not support the Servlet server of Web directly and can also pass the additional applied server and the mold pieces to support the Servlet. Receive benefit in the characteristic of the Java cross-platform, the Servlet is also a terrace irrelevant, actually, as long as match the norm of Java Servlet, the Servlet is complete to have nothing to do with terrace and is to have nothing to do with server of Web. Because the Java Servlet is internal to provide the service by the line distance, need not start a progress to the each claimses, and make use of the multi-threading mechanism can at the same time for several claim service, therefore the efficiency of Java Servlet is very high. But the Java Servlet also is not to has no weakness, similar to traditional CGI, ISAPI, the NSAPI method, the Java Servlet is to make use of to output the HTML language sentence to carry out the dynamic state web page of, if develop the whole website with the Java Servlet, the integration process of the dynamic state part and the static state page is an evil-foreboding dream simply. For solving this kind of weakness of",,

1002,Íõçå,SOURCE OF JSP  ,"    A number of years ago, Marty was invited to attend a small 20-person industry roundtable discussion on software technology. Sitting in the seat next to Marty was James Gosling, inventor of the Java programming language. Sitting several seats away was a high-level manager from a very large software company in Redmond, Washington. During the discussion, the moderator brought up the subject of Jini, which at that time was a new Java technology. The moderator asked the manager what he thought of it, and the manager responded that it was too early to tell, but that it seemed to be an excellent idea. He went on to say that they would keep an eye on it, and if it seemed to be catching on, they would follow his company's usual embrace and extend strategy. At this point, Gosling lightheartedly interjected You mean disgrace and distend.",,
1002,Íõçå,SOURCE OF JSP  ,"    Now, the grievance that Gosling was airing was that he felt that this company would take technology from other companies and suborn it for their own purposes. But guess what? The shoe is on the other foot here. The Java community did not invent the idea of designing pages as a mixture of static HTML and dynamic code marked with special tags. For example, Cold Fusion did it years earlier. Even ASP (a product from the very software company of the aforementioned manager) popularized this approach before JSP came along and decided to jump on the bandwagon. In fact, JSP not only adopted the general idea, it even used many of the same special tags as ASP did.",,

However, be a kind of script language, the JSP seemed to be too strong again, almost can use all Javas in the JSP. Be a kind of according to text originally of, take manifestation as the centraldevelopment technique, the JSP provided all advantages of the Java Servlet, and, when combine with a JavaBeans together, providing a kind of make contents and manifestation that simple way that logic separate. Separate the contents and advantage of logical manifestations is, the personnel who renews the page external appearance need not know the code of Java, and renew the JavaBeans personnel also need not be design the web page of expert in hand, can use to take the page of JavaBeans JSP to define the template of Web, to build up a from have the alike external appearance of the website that page constitute. JavaBeans completes the data to provide, having no code of Java in the template thus, this means that these templates can be written the personnel by a HTML plait to support. Certainly, can also make use of the Java Servlet to control the logic of the website, adjust through the Java Servlet to use the way of the document of JSP to separate website of logic and contents. Generally speaking, in actual engine of JSP, the page of JSP is the edit and translate type while carry out, not explain the type of. Explain the dynamic state web page development tool of the type, such as ASP, PHP3 etc., because speed etc. reason, have already can't satisfy current the large electronic commerce needs appliedly, traditional development techniques are all at to edit and translate the executive way change, such as the ASP ¡ú ASP+;PHP3 ¡ú PHP4. In the JSP norm book, did not request the procedure in the JSP code part( be called the Scriptlet) and must write with the Java definitely. Actually, have some engines of JSP are adoptive other script languages such as the EMAC- Script, etc., but actually this a few script languages also are to set up on the Java, edit and translate for the Servlet to carry out of. Write according to the norm of JSP, have no Scriptlet of relation with Java also is can of, however, mainly lie in the ability and JavaBeans, the Enterprise JavaBeanses because of the JSP strong function to work together, so even is the Scriptlet part not to use the Java, edit and translate of performance code also should is related with Java.",,

JavaBeans and ActiveX were published the company to expand to apply the procedure developer for Java and Windows to use to come to develop the complicated procedure quickly by the fast application procedure development( RAD) tool. These techniques make the expert in the some realm be able to write the module for the perpendicular application plait in the skill area, but the developer can go fetch the usage directly but need not control the expertise of this realm. Be a kind of take module as the central development terrace, the JSP appeared. It with the JavaBeans and Enterprise JavaBeans( EJB) module includes the model of the business and the data logic for foundation, provide a great deal of label and a script terraces to use to come to show in the HTML page from the contents of JavaBeans creation or send a present in return. Because of the property that regards the module as the center of the JSP, it can drive Java and not the developer of Java uses equally. Not the developer of Java can pass the JSP label( Tags) to use the JavaBeans that the deluxe developer of Java establish. The developer of Java not only can establish and use the JavaBeans, but also can use the language of Java to come to control more accurately in the JSP page according to the expression logic of the first floor JavaBeans.  See now how JSP is handle claim of HTTP. In basic claim model, a claim directly was send to JSP page in. The code of JSP controls to carry on hour of the logic processing and module of JavaBeanses' hand over with each other, and the manifestation result in dynamic state bornly, mixing with the HTML page of the static state HTML code. The Beans can be JavaBeans or module of EJBs. Moreover, the more complicated claim model can see make from is request other JSP pages of the page call sign or Java Servlets. The engine of JSP wants to chase the code of Java that the label of JSP, code of Java in the JSP page even all converts into the big piece together with the static state HTML contents actually.

The engine of JSP need to be edit and translate after Servlet the code end is modify only once, then this Servlet that editted and translate can be carry out. The in view of the fact JSP engine auto is born to edit and translate the Servlet also, need not procedure member begins to edit and translate the code, so the JSP can bring vivid sex that function and fast developments need that you are efficiently. Compared with the traditional CGI, the JSP has the equal advantage. First, on the speed, the traditional procedure of CGI needs to use the standard importation of the system to output the equipments to carry out the dynamic state web page born, but the JSP is direct is mutually the connection with server. And say for the CGI, each interview needs to add to add a progress to handle, the progress build up and destroy by burning constantly and will be a not small burden for calculator of be the server of Web.

1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,Summary of the book,,
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,"Witten and Frank's textbook was one of two books that I used for a data mining class in the Fall of 2001. The book covers all major methods of data mining that produce a knowledge representation as output. Knowledge representation is hereby understood as a representation that can be studied, understood, and interpreted by human beings, at least in principle. Thus, neural networks and genetic algorithms are excluded from the topics of this textbook. We need to say ¡°can be understood in principle¡± because a large decision tree or a large rule set may be as hard to interpret as a neural network.",,
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,"The book first develops the basic machine learning and data mining methods. These include decision trees, classification and association rules, support vector machines, instance-based learning, Naive Bayes classifiers, clustering, and numeric prediction based on linear regression, regression trees, and model trees. It then goes deeper into evaluation and implementation issues. Next it moves on to deeper coverage of issues such as attribute selection, discretization, data cleansing, and combinations of multiple models (bagging, boosting, and stacking). The final chapter deals with advanced topics such as visual machine learning, text mining, and Web mining.",,
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,A walk through the contents,,
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,The greatest strength of this Data Mining book lies outside of the book itself. All the algorithms described in this book are implemented and freely available through the WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge,Analysis),"Website (www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka). Chapter 8 of the book is a tutorial to the implemented algorithms. The integration between the book and the Web site is excellent, and the Web site is alive, thriving and growing. Thus, the number of data mining algorithms available on the Web site goes far beyond what is described in the book. Indeed, even Neural Networks have been added to the Web site since the book was first published. While many books offer an associated Web site by now, the close linkage between book and Web site and the rapid growth of the Web site are highly commendable."
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,"Another pleasant feature of the WEKA implementation is that it is done in Java. This makes it possible to construct systems, based on Java, that capitalize on the other strengths of Java, such as access to relational databases through JDBC and easy access to Web pages from within Java programs.",,

1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,"The book is written for academics and practitioners and I believe it can be well understood, even by undergraduate students.",,
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,"In fact, it is probably the most accessible survey of data mining in print, without sacrificing too much of precision and rigor. The book is written in a highly redundant style, which I would like to describe as an exercise in iterative deepening. Basic concepts are repeated in several chapters, but covered to a deeper level in the later chapters. This should make it easy for students to keep reading it, without having to refer back to earlier chapters at every step of the way. On the other hand, for a person that is already familiar with the basics of data mining, this makes boring reading at some places. However, I do not recommend a streamlining of the book. Instead, I recommend that readers with some knowledge of the topic may skip paragraphs that sound familiar without any guilty feelings.",,
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,Reviewer's appreciation,,
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,"The book goes to great lengths to avoid ¡°formula shock¡±. Formulas are developed step-by-step and well explained. Only absolutely necessary formulas are included. In many cases, where the derivation of a complex result is irrelevant to the actual data mining issues, the authors defer to statistics textbooks. While I am greatly in favor of both these approaches in writing textbooks, I feel that they have gone too far at a few places. At a number of places, the authors avoid introducing ``one more letter'' to keep the text readable. However, the price they pay for that is that many of their formulas have no equal signs. Thus, a sentence is terminated with a colon and followed with a formula, which is presumably equal to the quantity described by the sentence. This is done on many pages, e.g., 132--135, 137, 196, 207, 222, etc. Not in my wildest  dreams would I have thought that I could ever criticize a book author for having too few formulas and too few  variables.  But this is exactly what I need to do here. While I do not recommend eliminating the previously mentioned redundancy of description, I do recommend for the next edition (which this book will undoubtedly have) to strengthen the formulas, without necessarily adding new ones.",,
1004,¶¡³¿³¿,Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations,"At a few places, the book could also be improved by adding more explanations to figures. Figure 3.6 is a prime example for this issue. I found myself spending time verifying that instance counts in two subfigures truly add to the same total (of 209). They do. The reader could be spared this effort by a better caption or a better description in the body of the text.  Similarly, the Apriori algorithm is introduced in a figure, but only in the ¡°Further Reading¡± subsection (following much later) is the name of the algorithm mentioned. A better figure caption would help the scholarly advancement of students who might not take the ¡°Further Reading¡± section that seriously.",,
